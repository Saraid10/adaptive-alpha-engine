# Phase 46 Final Research Completion Package

## Status

Phase 46 completes the research project as a defensible paper/review package. It does not tune models, change labels, change candidate choice, rerun the locked holdout, or touch locked/final evaluation data.

## Final Project Identity

This is a validation-and-mechanism research project:

> HMM-guided contrastive regimes receive limited locked relative support, but the evidence does not support a profitable or deployable trading strategy.

## Submission Gate Matrix

| gate | status | evidence_or_action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| venue_scope | pass | AI+Finance, representation learning, validation/calibration, robustness, crypto/time-series fit. |
| claim_control | pass | Profitable/deployable strategy claim is blocked; limited locked relative support only. |
| locked_holdout_integrity | pass | Final candidate frozen before holdout; same-holdout retuning forbidden. |
| research_gate | pass | Full research-grade gate must pass immediately before submission. |
| double_blind | conditional_pass | No author block in generated source; Phase 46 records a final anonymity audit requirement. |
| page_budget | conditional_pass | Section budget targets eight total pages; final PDF still must be measured. |
| acm_template | conditional_pass | ACM/sigconf skeleton exists; final compile must use current venue template. |
| artifact_functionality | pass | Repro commands, tests, manifests, and gate reports are present. |
| artifact_availability | not_claimed | No DOI/persistent archive yet; availability badge must not be claimed. |
| final_submission | not_yet | Requires final PDF, citations, figures, anonymity audit, and advisor/reviewer pass. |

## Anonymity Audit

| check_id | pattern | status | action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| author_block | \\author\s*\{ | (?im)^#+\s*authors?\b | (?im)^authors?\s*: | pass | No explicit author block should appear in review manuscript. |
| acknowledgements | (?im)^#+\s*acknowledg | (?im)^acknowledg(e)?ments?\s*: | pass | Acknowledgements should be removed for double-blind review. |
| github_link | github\.com | pass | Public repository links can reveal identity during review. |
| personal_name_saransh | \bSaransh\b | pass | Personal names must not appear in the anonymous review PDF. |
| institution_marker | \bBTech\b | pass | Student/institution context is useful for viva but should be removed from anonymous paper. |
| codex_marker | \bCodex\b | pass | Tooling names should not appear in the anonymous paper claim story. |

## Final Claim Audit

| claim_id | status | safe_wording | blocked_wording |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| limited_locked_relative_support | satisfied | The frozen guided-HMM candidate satisfies the prewritten locked relative IC/Sharpe rule versus the two primary references. | The method broadly dominates all baselines. |
| positive_tradable_alpha | not_supported | Positive tradable alpha is not supported because locked Sharpe=-0.3691 and locked total return=-6.6%. | The strategy is profitable or deployable. |
| same_holdout_retuning | forbidden | The same locked holdout cannot be reused for model rescue. | Tune thresholds, labels, features, architecture, or candidate choice on the spent holdout. |
| artifact_availability | not_claimed | Artifacts are functional and documented; persistent artifact availability is deferred until DOI/archive exists. | Claim ACM artifact availability before a DOI or persistent archive exists. |

## Reviewer Objection Pack

| reviewer_objection | response | evidence_artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Why publish if the strategy is not profitable? | The contribution is validation and mechanism evidence: the project shows how an initially positive result fails under corrected validation, then reports the limited locked support honestly. | reports/phase45_external_research_audit.md; models/phase46_final_claim_audit.csv |
| Is this just overfitting to crypto? | The paper limits its claim to the registered crypto holdout and blocks generalization to other markets. | reports/claim_registry.md; reports/phase46_submission_readiness_audit.md |
| Why not report the higher-IC guided-GMM as the final method? | It was not the frozen final candidate and has worse locked Sharpe/return; switching after holdout would be post-hoc selection. | paper/phase45_venue_ready_manuscript.md |
| Are HMM states ground truth? | No. HMM states are weak proxy supervision and a sequential reference, not true market regimes. | models/phase46_final_claim_audit.csv |
| Can reviewers reproduce the result? | The project provides curated artifacts, manifests, run scripts, tests, and a full research-grade gate; DOI archive remains a Phase 46/47 pre-submission task if availability is claimed. | reports/phase46_final_research_completion.md |

## What Remains Before Actual External Submission

The research project is complete as a repository evidence package. External submission still requires final human-formatting steps: compile the ACM PDF, tighten citations, draw final figures, confirm current venue rules, run the final anonymity audit on the PDF, and create a DOI/persistent archive if artifact availability is claimed.
