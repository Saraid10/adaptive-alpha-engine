# Phase 47 Camera-Ready / Submission Gap List

## Still Open

1. Recompile `paper/phase47_submission_draft.tex` with the current venue ACM template before submission.
2. Re-measure final PDF length against the active call-for-papers page limit after all edits.
3. Replace any placeholder or weak citations after a final related-work pass.
4. Draw or intentionally omit each planned figure from `models/phase47_figure_manifest.csv`.
5. Run source, PDF content, and PDF metadata anonymity audits.
6. Decide whether to create a DOI archive before claiming artifact availability.
7. Get a human/advisor review of framing, claims, and formatting.
8. Clean remaining LaTeX/BibTeX warnings where they affect layout or venue compliance.
